----ui:

- perhaps should be a publish/subscribe model
..where game engine publishes events that update a user interface

- in the other direction, calls into the engine move it from state to state
  can be command line, remote, etc..

button -> begin partie
button -> start game
button -> envoie/pass
button:  play card x
some buttons will be disabled.  e.g. player 2 cannot play card x if it's not their turn
also player 2 can play only from valid cardset.


- ui feature:  bubbles for players speaking

- js has to be more object-oriented:  rather than create a whole list of functions, add functions to the group
 that represents a player area.
