----ui:

- implement/handle:
 passeDeuxFoi,
 second envoi,
 score display/update
 game end - clear game score
 partie score

- transitions, fine-tune timings


- make a nice prompter
- bubble -- does not treat both the bubble and the text as a single object

- js has to be more object-oriented:  rather than create a whole list of functions, add functions to the group
 that represents a player area.

-- switch to using actors between game and players?
