1.----ui componentization & cleanup & finish implementation:

- js has to be more object-oriented:  rather than create a whole list of functions, add functions to the group

- bubble -- does not treat both the bubble and the text as a single object
- make a nice prompter
- eliminate use of native alerts

- why paperjs?  why not just use canvas?
