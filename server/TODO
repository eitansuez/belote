----ui:

- js has to be more object-oriented:  rather than create a whole list of functions, add functions to the group
 that represents a player area.
- bubble -- does not treat both the bubble and the text as a single object
- make a nice prompter


- show player names / teams somewhere
- show connected status on page
- transitions, fine-tune timings


---- multiview

- client is a player or an observer
- player prompts are not published to all clients, only to player


---- why not just use canvas?
