bug:  sometimes one of the cards in a player's hand appears flipped on other players' screen.
then when card is played, it gets flipped and ends up hidden

so, context is as follows:
  - all four players are human
  - i'm at the bottom and i see the player on my right had one card uncovered.

what i'm not certain about is when did card get uncovered.  i would guess it happens when card is dealt?  but not necessarily.
find all points where a card is flipped or turned up.

can i write a test to reproduce this?


from saba..

orientation of players should be rotated where "me" is at the bottom

other players should know who's currently being waited on

score area can be smaller / font size should be bigger / would make it white letters, straight against the green

player name fonts should be large

prompt is on top of the cards / obstructs them

add sounds (e.g. when play a card)

place "current" atout to the side of the player (instead of in front of)
