1. fix broken tests
2. update TextUI
3. organize/sort player's hand by suit, by value/ordinal


>> bug:  belote rebelote credit not given when have a capot (fixed, but need to write/add test)

>> may have noticed while playing:  when partner is master, player must:
 - follow suit
 - but if don't have, can play anything, including an atout

?. calculate/add/show dix-dedere as part of last round score instead of adding it to the gamescore separately ??


2.-----logging wording:
 make card placement log wording semantic:  "Eitan cuts with .."
  or "Johnny follows suit with .."
  or "Corinne monte with .."

 likewise, should state at end of each game "stat" such as:
  - team x wins after having committed to trefle

3.-----switch to using actors between game and players?

4.-----play strategies:
 how to build a decent playing strategy?
 should human players plug in as a strategy?
 should Strategy be mixed in to Player with groovy traits?

 introduce a more intelligent strategy and try it out for an ai
 then setup three ai's and play with them to see how well this works out.
 or.. come up with an algorithm to teach behavior based on desired outcomes.
