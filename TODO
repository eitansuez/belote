 finish the logging:

 extend to partie:  show partie score as move along
 would like card placement wording to be semantic:  "Eitan cuts with .."
  or "Johnny follows suite with .."
  or "Corinne montes with .."

 want test that plays a full partie to 1000 and displays winner

 likewise should state at end of each game "stat" such as:
  - team x remporte after having committed to trefle
  or
  - team x dedans
  - or team y capot
  - or team x litige

rarities though possibilities:  envoyeur is capot
what happens if two litige d'affiles?


 look into fsm's in groovy
 build out fsm for game, partie

 flesh out the development of a hand, and the play of a hand in turns,

 flesh out the envoi selection process/phase:
   first selection round, second, fact that game may end without any hands played if no one envoie's

 handle belotte rebelotte

 rules i encoded for cutting/raising are incorrect:
   if partner cut, then you're not obligated to play an atout.
   find out either way and update tests & fix implementation accordingly

 start refactoring implementation of "random play" as a pluggable strategy
 then come up with a more intelligent strategy and try it out for an ai

 then setup three ai's and play with them to see how well this works out.
 or.. come up with an algorithm to teach behavior based on desired outcomes.
