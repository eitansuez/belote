    - when game is forfeit, animate moving all cards to deck position

    - write test for play card with belote, with rebelote
    - animate the flipping of a card
    - still have bug with card.moveAbove(previousCard) -- i think i know now --
    the zordering has to take place after the last card has finished moving.
      it happens too early and then some other card is moved into place and brought to front.

>  make card placement log wording semantic:  "Eitan cuts with ..", or "Johnny follows suit with ..", or "Corinne monte with .."
   likewise, should state at end of each game "stat" such as:  "team x wins after having committed to trefle"
> scrolling log of events:  dedans, capot, messages notifying players of events

> partie build should visually come before table is even drawn, or perhaps should be overlaid on top of table.

> object oriented javascript
 - oopify table

> externalize definitions of ScoreArea and Bubble
> implement an alert for notification to replace scaffold window.alert

> for a partie, show all games, and rounds within each game, with scores, so can review
> ability for a client to receive a full log of events to reconstruct game state (i.e. join in the middle of a game and reconstruct game state)

------and more..

- switch to using actors between game and players?

- play strategies:
 how to build a decent playing strategy?
 should human players plug in as a strategy?
 should Strategy be mixed in to Player with groovy traits?

 introduce a more intelligent strategy and try it out for an ai
 then setup three ai's and play with them to see how well this works out.
 or.. come up with an algorithm to teach behavior based on desired outcomes.


- deeper into paperjs:  how to write components for paperjs?
- show dernier pli
- onResize handler to redraw table

- transitions/animations:
    - score update (highlight/fade)
    - introduce rotation in animations/transitions
    - employ fade/appear effect

- option for ui to display other players' cards face up

- perhaps:  similar to collabedit:  unique url for a game room that can go back to
- ability to leave game (close window) and get back to it
- ability to cancel/stop a game in progress
- support multiple games in progress
- monitor all games in progress

-javascript tests
