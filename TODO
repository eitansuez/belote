- flesh out 'pass/envoi' events to client

- need to figure out how to async notify server of events
  then perhaps introduce a delay in dealing cards, etc..

- how do messages go in the other direction?
  how does logic wait for input?  don't want to block.  rather would like a state machine
  with incoming messages triggering transitions whenever they come in

- logic should have complete set of emit for all events that need to be communicated to ui

- show player names
- show score
- handle a full game
- handle a full partie

- logic:  partie.winner -- what if both have, say, 1010 -- one will have 1013 and the other 1009.
  write test for this scenario
