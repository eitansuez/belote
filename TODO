- need to figure out how to async notify server of events
  then perhaps introduce a delay in dealing cards, etc..

- how do messages go in the other direction?
  how does logic wait for input?  don't want to block.  rather would like a state machine
  with incoming messages triggering transitions whenever they come in

- show player names
- show score
- handle a full game
- handle a full partie
