Partie with Unique Identifier (xasdf)
send request to create a new partie on server, it returns unique identifier, and notifies all users
each user maintains a list of parties

page/template:  create partie

team1:
player1: _____
player2: _____

team2:
player1: _____
player2: _____

start

only action a user above can take is place himself in one of the available slots.
once you select a slot, that event needs to be communicated to other users so their view can reflect your action,
  and that slot is now marked taken

 -> newPartie is basically a stomp call (client.send /newPartie with partie data (json-marshalled))
  but also need to ensure that ui is ready to receive events from server for each human player.
